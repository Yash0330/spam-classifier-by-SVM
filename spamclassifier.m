% ===========  Train Linear SVM for Spam Classification ========
%  In this section, you will train a linear classifier to determine if an
%  email is Spam or Not-Spam.

% Load the Spam Email dataset
% You will have X, y in your environment
load('spamTrain.mat');

fprintf('\nTraining Linear SVM (Spam Classification)\n')
fprintf('(this may take 1 to 2 minutes) ...\n')

C = 0.1;
model = svmTrain(X, y, C, @linearKernel);

p = svmPredict(model, X);

fprintf('Training Accuracy: %f\n', mean(double(p == y)) * 100);

% ===================  Test Spam Classification ================
%  After training the classifier, we can evaluate it on a test set. I have
%  included a test set in spamTest.mat

% Load the test dataset
% You will have Xtest, ytest in your environment
load('spamTest.mat');

fprintf('\nEvaluating the trained Linear SVM on a test set ...\n')

p = svmPredict(model, Xtest);

fprintf('Test Accuracy: %f\n', mean(double(p == ytest)) * 100);

% ===================  Try Your Own Emails =====================
%  Now that you've trained the spam classifier, you can use it on your own
%  emails! In the starter code, we have included spamSample1.txt,
%  spamSample2.txt, emailSample1.txt and emailSample2.txt as examples. 
%  The following code reads in one of these emails and then uses your 
%  learned SVM classifier to determine whether the email is Spam or 
%  Not Spam

% Set the file to be read in (change this to spamSample2.txt,
% emailSample1.txt or emailSample2.txt to see different predictions on
% different emails types). Try your own emails as well!
filename = 'spamSample1.txt';

% Read and predict
file_contents = readFile(filename);
word_indices  = processEmail(file_contents);
x             = emailFeatures(word_indices);
p = svmPredict(model, x);

fprintf('\nProcessed %s\n\nSpam Classification: %d\n', filename, p);
fprintf('(1 indicates spam, 0 indicates not spam)\n\n');
